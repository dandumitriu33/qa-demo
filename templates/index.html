        <h3>[News] We have 5 users, yay!</h3>
        <p>
            This week we reached the long awaited milestone of 5 registered users. The
            staff will be having a party and will post pictures in the following days.
            Thanks y'all!

        <h3>[Feature request] Database for home page articles</h3>
        <p>
            The admins have been asking for this for a very long time. They want to have
            the latest 5 events on the home page. Maybe a database and "Add new event" page
            could do the trick? They are waiting and it's worth 2000 points.
